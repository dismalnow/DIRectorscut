# DIRector Cut ðŸŽ¬

ðŸš€ **DIRectorscut_v2.py** is a Python script that **renames movie directories** into a clean and standardized format.  
It ensures your collection follows a proper naming convention:

Movie Title (Year) [movie version] [resolution] [video codec] [audio encoding] 

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Removes website references** (e.g., `www.Torrenting.com -`).
- **Prompts for approval** before renaming.
- **Skip (S) Option** â€“ Skip renaming without logging.
- **Supports common video/audio formats** like `[x265]`, `[DTS]`, `[TrueHD]`.
- **Handles multiple movie versions** like `[Unrated]`, `[Extended]`, `[Directorâ€™s Cut]`.
- **"Approve All" (A) feature** â€“ Includes commented-out "Approve All" (`A`) feature.

## ðŸš¨ Executable File Warning
Before renaming, **DIRectorscut_v2.py** scans for **.exe files** inside your movie directories.  
If found, you will be prompted to **delete or keep each one manually**.  

**Example Warning:**
Found: X:\Movies\DangerousFile.exe Delete this file? (Y/N/Q to quit)

You can choose to:
- **(Y)** Delete the file.
- **(N)** Keep the file.
- **(Q)** Quit the script immediately.

This prevents **potential malware or unnecessary executables** from staying in your collection.
