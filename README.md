# DIRector Cut ðŸŽ¬

ðŸš€ **DIRectorscut_v1.py** is a script that **renames movie directories** into a clean and standardized format.  
It ensures your collection's directories follow a sane naming convention structure like:

Movie Title (Year) [video codec] [audio encoding] [movie version]

## ðŸ›  Features
- Prompts for approval before renaming.
- Extracts key details: **Title, Year, Codec, Audio Format, Version (Unrated, Extended, etc.).**
- Skips unnecessary clutter like `[BluRay]`, `[WEBRip]`, `[YTS]`, etc.
- **Asks the user for the movie directory** instead of hardcoding it.
- Keeps your library **organized and beautiful**.
